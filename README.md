To  make  a  simple  chat  bot,  all  you  need  is  a  function  that  takes  a  string  as  input  (what  
somebody  said)  and  returns  another  string  (the  bot's  response).  A  more  complex  bot  would  have  a  
longer memory but responding to a single sentence is more than hard enough, so let's stick with that. 
The main part of this assignment is to make a little chat server with a couple of bad chat bots on it.
